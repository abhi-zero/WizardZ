# WizardZ

**WizardZ** is a modern digital marketing agency website built as a frontend learning project. It features animated UI elements, a showcase of marketing services, and case studies, all powered by [GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)](https://greensock.com/gsap/). The project is inspired by concepts and tutorials from the Sheriyan YouTube channel, but all code and design are original and created from scratch as part of a hands-on learning process.

> **Note:** This project is currently **not responsive**. Responsive design will be added in the future as part of the learning journey.

## 🖥️ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhi-zero/WizardZ#
   cd WizardZ
   ```

2. **Open `index.html` in your browser.**
   - No build steps or dependencies required—everything runs in the browser.

3. **(Optional) Serve with Live Server:**
   - For the best experience, use a local server (like VSCode Live Server) to avoid CORS issues with local fonts and images.

## 📚 Learning Notes

- **Animations:** All animations are hand-coded using GSAP timelines and ScrollTrigger for scroll-based effects.
- **Inspiration:** The project is inspired by the Sheriyan YouTube channel, but all code and design are original and not copy-pasted.
- **Purpose:** This project is a personal learning exercise to master frontend development, animation, and modern web design.
- **Responsiveness:** The site is currently not responsive. Responsive design will be added as a future improvement.
- **Brand Logos:** The brand logos section is included as part of the design inspiration. The original designer is currently unknown; a link will be added once identified.
